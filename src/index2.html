    <h1>MSU Interim President John Engler says Nassar survivors are 'enjoying' the 'spotlight'</h1>

    <p>Gepubliceerd op 12 januari 2019</p>

    Interim Michigan State president John Engler tendered his resignation Wednesday, less than a week after saying that
    some victims of convicted sexual predator Larry Nassar are "enjoying" the "spotlight" they are in.

    In his 11-page resignation letter, Engler said he would leave his post effective 9 a.m. on Jan. 23.

    The university's board had scheduled a meeting for Thursday to discuss a "personnel action." While it was not known
    what that action was to be, the meeting was to come on the heels of an interview with The Detroit News during which
    Engler said:

    "You've got people, they are hanging on and this has been ... there are a lot of people who are touched by this,
    survivors who haven't been in the spotlight. In some ways they have been able to deal with this better than the ones
    who've been in the spotlight who are still enjoying that moment at times, you know, the awards and recognition.
    And it's ending. It's almost done."

    This was in relation to a fund the university recently revived to pay for the costs of counseling for the victims
    of Nassar, 55. Last January, Nassar was sentenced to 40-175 years in prison after sexually abusing more than 150
    females while serving as a physician for Michigan State and for USA Gymnastics.
