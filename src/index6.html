    <h1>American anchor for Iranian TV is arrested on visit to US</h1>
    <p>Gepubliceerd op 17 januari 2019</p>

    NEW ORLEANS (AP) â€” A prominent American anchorwoman on Iranian state television has been arrested by the
    FBI during a visit to the U.S., the broadcaster reported Wednesday, and her son said she was being held in a
    prison, apparently as a material witness.

    Marzieh Hashemi, who worked for the network's English-language service, was detained in St. Louis, where she
    had filmed a Black Lives Matter documentary after visiting relatives in the New Orleans area. She was then taken
    to Washington, according to her elder son, Hossein Hashemi.

    The FBI said in an email that it had no comment on the arrest of the woman who was born Melanie Franklin in New
    Orleans and has worked for Iran's state television network for 25 years.

    Hossein Hashemi said his mother lives in Tehran and comes back to this country about once a year to see her family,
    usually scheduling documentary work somewhere in the U.S. as well.

    <em>ok dan...</em>

    "We still have no idea what's going on," said Hashemi, a research fellow at the University of Colorado who was
    interviewed by phone from Washington. He also said he and his siblings had been subpoenaed to appear before a
    grand jury.

    The incident comes as Iran faces increasing criticism of its own arrests of dual citizens and other people with
    Western ties. Those cases have previously been used as bargaining chips in negotiations with world powers.

    Federal law allows judges to order witnesses to be arrested and detained if the government can prove their
    testimony has extraordinary value for a criminal case and that they would be a flight risk and unlikely to
    respond to a subpoena. The statute generally requires those witnesses to be promptly released once they are deposed.

    <em>lekker dan...</em>

    Marzieh Hashemi, an American citizen, had not been contacted by the FBI before she was detained and would
    "absolutely" have been willing to cooperate with the agency, her son said.

    Asked whether his mother had been involved in any criminal activity or knew anyone who might be implicated in a
    crime, Hashemi said, "We don't have any information along those lines."
